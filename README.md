## DESCRIPTION OF DATASET
A dataset found on Kaggle.com will be used in our analysis and prediction. The dataset consists of 4600 rows of homes for sale or sold during a 3 month period. There are 18 columns listing the home's attributes. 

## STRATEGY
Various techniques will be used to clean, analyze and visualize the dataset in order to predict the homeâ€™s value. Variables that drive residential property values include, but are not limited to, price, square foot of home, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square foot of lot, amenities and location.

## EXECUTION
Clean and modify dataset via Jupyter Notebook
Conduct exploratory analysis (plots) to target key questions and features
Split dataset into training data and testing data
Run appropriate algorithms to obtain base model
Train and test the model with common algorithms 
Make and evaluate predictions (and fine tune as necessary)
Choose the best predictions

### ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS
Additional data science and visualization tools/programs are used to create graphs, plots and maps    that will add additional insight into our analysis and predictions.
